The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials.

To incorporate these styles into a Jekyll theme, I have made some very slight modifications that attempt to maintain the feel of the CSS styles in his Github repo.

Note that this is a full-width layout. This was accomplished by including ```layout: full-width``` in the YAML front matter for this page. Keep in mind that all the Tufte-Jekyll sidenote and marginnote goodness will not work on full-width layouts! 

You can find the source code for Jekyll at [github.com/jekyll/jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
